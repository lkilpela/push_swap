## 🎮 About The Project

`push_swap` is a coding project part of the Hive Helsinki curriculum. The goal of this project is to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of operations, in the smallest number of moves possible.

In this project, the program takes a list of integers as arguments and outputs a series of operations that sort the list. The operations are limited to a specific set and the goal is to find the most efficient way to sort the list.

This project was completed as a **solo project**. It provided an opportunity to learn about data structures (specifically stacks), sorting algorithms, and algorithm optimization.

### ⭐ Features

- Sorts a stack of integers using a second stack and a limited set of operations.
- Outputs the operations used to sort the list.
- Handles errors and provides appropriate error messages.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- `gcc` or `clang`
- `make`

### 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/push_swap.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd push_swap`
3. Compile the project: `make`

### 🕹️ How to Use

Run the program with the following syntax: `./push_swap [list of integers]`
For example, you could run: `./push_swap 3 2 1 6 5 8`
This will sort the numbers and display the operations used to sort them.

## 📝 Evaluation Requirements

The `push_swap` project was evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Functionality**: The program must correctly sort a stack of integers using a second stack and a limited set of operations. The output should be the operations used to sort the list.

2. **Efficiency**: The solution should aim for the smallest number of operations. The efficiency of your algorithm will be tested against a set of random inputs.

3. **Error Handling**: The program must handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate error messages. This includes handling invalid arguments and incorrect number of arguments.

4. **Code Quality**: The code must be clear, concise, and efficient. It should be well-organized and easy to read. Proper use of functions, variables, and other programming constructs is expected.

5. **Compiling**: The project must compile without any errors or warnings using the provided Makefile.

6. **Memory Management**: The program must manage memory correctly, with no memory leaks.
